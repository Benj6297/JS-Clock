# Build a JavaScript clock.

If this seems like a challenging exercise that is okay. I want you to push your self.

**make sure to fork and clone the repo** to do that click the fork button and then navigate to you repositories and got to the one that has the same name as this when ang click the clone button. There should be an option to do so with gitHub desktop app.

after that follow the steps below.

### Steps

1. link css file to html with the `<link> `html tag, keep in mind `<link>` tags have no closing tag like regular html elements and they need to be put inside the Head of the index.html file or another way of saying that is, they need to go in the head of the
   document.
2. link the script.js file with the `<script></script>` html tag
3. Make sure that the `<script></script>` it is placed inside the `<body></body>` tag below `<main></main>` html tag.
4. you'll know you have JavaScript and css working when the page turns black, and you git a console.log the says working. and an alert that also will say working.
